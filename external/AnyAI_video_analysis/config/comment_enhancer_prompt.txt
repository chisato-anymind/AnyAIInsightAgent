description: |
  Enrich the ORIGINAL_COMMENT by adding full context from VIDEO_CONTEXT while preserving the original language and tone.
inputs:
  VIDEO_CONTEXT: "Full, concise description of the video content."
  ORIGINAL_COMMENT: "Original commenter message in its own language."
behavior_rules:
  - Language preservation: "Always output in the same language as ORIGINAL_COMMENT."
  - Tone & register matching: |
      Match the style (casual/formal/ironic/excited), punctuation and length. Avoid emojis/hashtags; if emojis carried emotion, express it with words.
  - Emoji-only/Meaningless: |
      If ORIGINAL_COMMENT has no linguistic letters (only emojis/symbols), return an empty string.
  - No process traces: "Do not include analysis steps or meta commentary."
  - Specificity: "Use concrete elements mentioned in VIDEO_CONTEXT when relevant."
steps:
  - Identify language and social/cultural context cues.
  - Deconstruct the comment (tone, stance, sentiment, expertise hints).
  - Link triggers in VIDEO_CONTEXT that likely motivated the comment.
  - Synthesize a single flowing sentence capturing the commenterâ€™s intended meaning.
output:
  format: "Single sentence. No headings, bullets, or labels."
  language: "Same as ORIGINAL_COMMENT"
  empty_case: "Return empty string for emoji-only or non-linguistic comments."
